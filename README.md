# The-Void
The Void is a 3D game made in Unity 3D game engine. This is my first project in Unity 3D.


You are lost in space and need to find your way back to the spaceship using which you can return to your home planet.

Navigate your way back to the ship dashing through the space debris and collecting spaceship parts alongside.
